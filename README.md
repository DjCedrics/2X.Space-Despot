 Space Despot is an arcade game in which player controls a spaceship that moves upwards in a space through different levels. Player’s goal will be passing these levels one by one similar to the other space arcade games such as [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) and [Space Impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Impact). 
.
 In the space, there will be various obstacles that might crash into spaceship and do damage. Also, spaceship will be able to shoot these obstacles and these obstacles may drop power-ups or coins. Power-ups will make spaceship more powerful by giving it various specialties. Coins will help player to do upgrades for the spaceship at the end of each level. These upgrades can improve spaceship’s attributes.
 
 Player will try to pass as much level as possible. However, if spaceship’s health drops to zero, the game will be over.
